\begin{abstract}
Scholars and policymakers increasingly recognize the value of social capital - the connections that generate and enable trust among people - in responding to and recovering from shocks and disasters. However, some communities have more social infrastructure, that is, sites that produce and maintain social capital, than others. Community centers, libraries, public pools, and parks serve as locations where people can gather, interact, and build social ties. Much research on urban spaces relies on Google maps because of its ubiquity and this article tests the degree to which it can accurately, reliably, and effectively capture social infrastructure. In this study, we map the social infrastructure of Boston using Google Maps Places API and then ground truth our measures, mapping social infrastructure on street corners with in-person site observations to evaluate the accuracy of available data. We find that though we may need to use multi-vectored measurement when trying to capture social infrastructure, Google maps serve as reliable measurements with a predictable, acceptable margin of error.

\section{Introduction}


With the onset of climate change-induced floods, fires, and storms, as well as the global COVID-19 pandemic, a wave of recent scholarship has examined social infrastructure to approximate community resilience to crisis, referring to the capacity of neighborhoods to bounce back after crisis \citep{rivera_and_nickels_2014, aldrich_and_meyer_2015, aldrich_and_kiyota_2017, fraser_et_al_2021_GEC}. Early work from social scientists highlighted that the strength of social ties in communities often depends greatly on the built environment, stemming from everyday cafes and corner stores \citep{jacobs_1961}, day care centers \citep{small_2009}, and, yes, even bowling alleys \citep{putnam_2000}. These sites can provide social glue for residents, providing or standing in for the reputation and trust that help build social networks \citep{bourdieu_1986, coleman_1988, lin_2001, glanville_and_bienenstock_2009}.
